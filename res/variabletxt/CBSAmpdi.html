<p><strong>Metropolitan Power Diffusion Index</strong></p>
<p>David Miller (2012) developed this index to adress the relative invsibility of small governemnts in the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index. The index accounts for the role of small jurisdictions in the diffusion of power in metropolitan areas. The index is between 1 and infinity. In a metro area with an index of 1, institutional power would be very concentrated, in only one jurisdiction (i.e. a county). As the index gets larger, population would be scattered between many smaller local governments.</p>
<p>For every metropolitan area \(M\), with a number \(N\) of institutions \(i\), every institution with a population of \({Pop}_{i}\), the Metropolitan Power Diffusion Index \({MDPI}_{M}\) is:
\[
MDPI_{ M }=\sum_{ i=1 }^{ N }  \sqrt { \frac { Pop_{ i } }{ \sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { Pop }_{ i } }  }  }
\]</p>
<p>The MPDI gives more weight to small institutions than to big ones. The reasoning is that the importance of an institution decreases with its share of the population. One person added to an already big jurisdiction counts less for the dynamics of the metropolitan area than one person added to a small jurisdiction.</p>
