<p><strong>Hirschman-Herfindahl Index of Power Dilution</strong></p>
<p>Albert Hirschmann and Orris Herfindahl independently developed this index in 1945 and 1950 to study market concentration in industries. Daniel KÃ¼bler (2005) applied it to metropolitan fragmentation in the swiss context. This index is inverted here to show dilution rather than concentration. The index is always between 0 and 1. In a metro area with an index of 1, institutionnal power would be very diluted, with its population scatered between many local governements. In a metro area with an index of 0, institutional power would be very concentrated, with only one local government.</p>
<p>For every metropolitan area \(M\), with a number \(N\) of institutions \(i\), every institution with a population of \({Pop}_{i}\), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of Concentration \({HHI}_{M}\) is:\[{ HHI }_{ M }=\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { \left( \frac { { Pop }_{ i } }{ \sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { Pop }_{ i } }  }  \right)  }^{ 2 } }\]</p>
