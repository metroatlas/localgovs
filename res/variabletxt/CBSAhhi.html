<p><strong>Hirschman-Herfindahl Index of Power Dilution</strong></p>
<p>Albert Hirschmann (1945) and Orris Herfindahl (1950) independently developed this index to study market concentration in industries. Daniel Kübler (2005) applied it to metropolitan fragmentation in the swiss context. This index is inverted here to show dilution rather than concentration. The index is always between 0 and 1. In a metro area with an index of 1, institutional power would be very diluted, with its population scattered between many local governments. In a metro area with an index of 0, institutional power would be very concentrated, with only one local government.</p>
<p>For every metropolitan area \(M\), with a number \(N\) of institutions \(i\), every institution with a population of \({Pop}_{i}\), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of Concentration \({HHI}_{M}\) is:\[{ HHI }_{ M }=\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { \left( \frac { { Pop }_{ i } }{ \sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { Pop }_{ i } }  }  \right)  }^{ 2 } }\]</p>
<p>The HHI gives more weight to big institutions than to small ones. The reasonning is that the importance of an institution grows with its share of the population. One person added to an already big jurisdiction counts more for the dynamics of the metropolitan area than one person added to a small jurisdiction.</p>
